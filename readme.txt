store-database-script.sql will create and populate the database and table used by 
this web app.

There are comments in the .java and .jsp files regarding the specifications provided
by the professor. I am confident this submission fully meets the requirements we
were provided. If any questions arise or I can help clear up any confusion about 
what was requested, please do not hesitate to contact me at get26@txstate.edu .

The following is the entirety of the instructions Dr. Visinescu provided us:

"
In this project you will create a shopping page with products populated from a database. The name of the database is Store and the name of the table of products is Products. The name of the pictures is pic1, pic2...pic10.

In the database will be one table only with columns: ProdID(product id), ProdName(product name), ProdDesc (product description), ProdPrice(product price), ProdQuant(product quantity), ProdPictLocation(product location). The product location contains a string that points to a folder with pictures in which yo uhave pictures of all the products. You will not use more than 10 products/pictures.

After you create the first page (Hint: jsp using jstl to get all the products from the database), you have to be able to add the products to a shopping cart. The shopping cart will contain the products with all the information available in the database plus the number of products added of each kind. 

In a checkout page you will display the content of the shopping cart and add an update button fro each product so that the quantities can be modified for each product.
